# The description of the application:

The key point of this project is to educate farmers about those toxic chemicals. By the way, the farmer will know if they use those toxic chemicals, 
they need to pay more attention. Because the farmers do not wear enough protective equipment when they are applying those chemicals. 
The skin of the farmers absorbs the sprayed chemicals. This might lead to a lot of chronic diseases, especially cancer.

In fact, no government regulation is implemented to solve this question. 
And the farmers actually dislike wear protective equipment because the equipment might result to a hard labour. 
For example, the sweltering heat and damp skin due to gear make farmers' jobs difficult.

The below picture shows the main functions and the usability.

For the app functions:
they should be following timeframe.

For usability:
The farmer might be unable to read the instruction book and the description of the application functions.
By the way, using speaking button is essential. Listenning the application information should be available for the farmers.

The below picture shows an example of the app home scream.

In the upper right corner of the picture, the national flag is a function to change the language of the application. 
The application should be able to change language between English and Cambodian. But the application do not need to change the audio to Cambodian. 
The search function should be added. Moreover, to the left of each rows, there is a symbol of a speaker, which is an AUDIO button. 
The farmer can use it to hear the voice message in the corresponding row.

The provided data is the information that is essential on the pesticide package. For example, a red frame on the below picture points the words “fosetyl-aluminum”. 
That is toxic. The application should show all the information about the chemical when the farmers are searching.

There is an example at here to show what happen when clicking the row. For the first row, it is about rats.
Before the farmer purchases the pesticide to kill rats, they can click the “Rats” row. The rats page should be showed and the page lists which chemical can kill rats.

In order to make sense, there is another example. When the farmers click diseases the below picture (example picture) should be showed. 
The page need to list the pesticides that might cause diseases. Moreover, the farmers can also search the functions or go back to the home page.

After that, when the farmers click one of the pesticides. The detail of the pesticide should be showed like the below picture.

This page will state the level and harmfulness of the toxic pesticide. 
Moreover, the steps of processing the pesticide including purchase, store, apply and so on should be showed on this page. 
Furthermore, the audio, home, and language button are also available.
